`pf_report_t` is the single output of every backtest. This page maps
each field to its meaning and units.

@see #pf_report_t for the verbatim struct declaration.

## Trade fields

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `total_trades` | `int` | Closed-trade count. Always equal to `trades_len`. |
| `trades` | `pf_trade_t*` | Heap array, ordered by exit time ascending. |
| `trades_len` | `int` | Length of `trades`. |
| `net_profit` | `double` | Sum of all closed-trade PnL in account currency. |

### pf_trade_t

```c
typedef struct pf_trade_s {
    int64_t entry_time;     /* Unix ms */
    int64_t exit_time;      /* Unix ms */
    double  entry_price;    /* incl. slippage */
    double  exit_price;
    double  pnl;            /* net of commission, in account ccy */
    double  pnl_pct;        /* relative to entry capital */
    int     is_long;        /* 1 = long, 0 = short */
    double  max_runup;      /* peak favorable price travel ($/unit qty) */
    double  max_drawdown;   /* peak adverse price travel ($/unit qty) */
    double  qty;            /* filled quantity */
} pf_trade_t;
```

`max_runup` and `max_drawdown` are the **per-unit** Maximum Favorable
Excursion (MFE) and Maximum Adverse Excursion (MAE) for the trade —
multiply by `qty` to recover the dollar values.

## Bar processing

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `input_bars_processed` | Source-feed bars consumed. |
| `script_bars_processed` | Script-timeframe bars evaluated. Differs from `input_bars_processed` when `needs_aggregation == 1`. |

## Timeframe metadata

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `input_tf_seconds` | Detected (or configured) input timeframe, in seconds. |
| `script_tf_seconds` | Script timeframe, in seconds. |
| `script_tf_ratio` | `script_tf_seconds / input_tf_seconds`. |
| `needs_aggregation` | `1` if input was aggregated up to script TF; `0` if pass-through. |
| `bar_magnifier_enabled` | `1` if the magnifier ran on this backtest. |

See [Timeframes](@ref timeframes) for how the runtime resolves these
values from the inputs to #run_backtest_full.

## Security diagnostics

A Pine strategy can call `request.security()` from multiple call sites.
The runtime tracks each site independently.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `security_feeds_total` | Higher-TF feed bars consumed across all sites. |
| `security_complete_total` | Evaluations on completed parent bars. |
| `security_partial_total` | Evaluations on still-forming parent bars. |
| `security_diag[i]` | Per-site counters. See #pf_security_diag_t. |
| `security_diag_len` | Number of `request.security` sites. |

## Bar magnifier diagnostics

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `magnifier_sub_bars_total` | Sub-bars synthesized by the magnifier. |
| `magnifier_sample_ticks_total` | Sample ticks visited by the magnifier. |

A "sub-bar" is one synthetic intra-bar OHLC slice; a "sample tick" is
one fill-resolution probe within that slice. With the default
`PF_MAGNIFIER_ENDPOINTS` distribution and `magnifier_samples = 4`,
expect `~4 * input_bars_processed` sample ticks.

See [Bar magnifier](@ref magnifier) for the full sampling model.

## Trace records

Populated only when:

1. The source script contains `// @pf-trace name=expr` pragmas, **and**
2. #strategy_set_trace_enabled was called with `1` before the run.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `trace[i].timestamp` | Bar timestamp (Unix ms). |
| `trace[i].bar_index` | Zero-based bar index within the run. |
| `trace[i].name_id` | Index into `trace_names`. |
| `trace[i].value` | Traced expression value on this bar. |
| `trace_names[k]` | Name string for `name_id == k`. Lifetime: until #strategy_free. |

Trace records are zero-cost when disabled — no allocation, no
formatting, no per-bar branch.

## Lifetime and ownership

Every heap pointer in `pf_report_t` is freed by a single call to
#report_free:

```c
pf_report_t r = {0};
run_backtest(s, bars, n, &r);
/* ... use r ... */
report_free(&r);   /* frees trades, security_diag, trace */
```

@warning `trace_names` points into a string table owned by the **strategy
handle**, not the report. The pointer is valid until #strategy_free is
called on the handle that produced it. If you keep trace data past
that, copy the strings out first.
