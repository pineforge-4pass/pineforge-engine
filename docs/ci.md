# Local verification and CI

Start with the fast preflight used by GitHub Actions. Install actionlint 1.7.12
and ShellCheck, then run:

```sh
python3 scripts/ci_preflight.py
```

This checks the CI/native workflow syntax, expressions and shell commands,
source ABI/hash/schema guards, and the verifier's failure-handling tests. A
failure blocks all compilation lanes and retains logs in `build-ci-preflight/`.
It does not compile the engine or replace any complete verification profile.

Then use the same verification entrypoint as GitHub Actions before publishing:

```sh
python3 scripts/ci_verify.py release --build-dir build --jobs 4
```

The command runs source guards, configures and rebuilds every enabled target,
prepares the real historical ABI providers, runs CTest, installs the package,
and builds and runs the `find_package` consumer. The smoke test compares the
installed library's reported version with `VERSION`. After a successful build,
a failing test suite does not hide a separate install or package failure.
Release and native profiles also install into a disposable prefix, remove the
source-only header trees, and compile the native public roots and examples;
the preflight source guard rejects those includes before a build.

CI pins Ubuntu 24.04 and macOS 26, the platforms used by the preceding green
refactor PR, and selects Python 3.12 explicitly. CMake uses the same interpreter as the
verification driver, so its Python checks do not switch to a different system
Python. CTest must discover tests; an empty suite is a failure.

## Profiles

| Profile | Build | Additional coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `release` | Release, tutorial enabled | Standard CI checks, installed package, and installed native include-independence proof |
| `debug` | Debug, tutorial enabled | The same checks without Release optimization |
| `sanitizers` | Debug, ASan and UBSan | Instrumented library, tests and installed consumer; Linux CI also requires leak detection |
| `native` | Release, live runner enabled | Parser, journal, transport tests, installed runner help, and installed native include-independence proof |
| `kernel` | Release, live runner enabled, Pine source layer OFF | The source-free CTest set behind a row floor (`KERNEL_MIN_TESTS`; `--min-tests N` overrides it), installed package, and the `nm` half of the include-independence proof over `libpineforge_kernel.a` |

By default each profile uses `build-ci-<profile>`. Keep separate build directories
for different profiles and toolchains. The verifier never deletes a build tree
or replaces an incompatible historical ABI receipt. Use a fresh directory when
its configuration no longer matches.

Run Release, Debug and sanitizer profiles sequentially in one checkout, or use
separate worktrees for parallel runs. Their tutorial targets write shared `.so`
files under `tutorial/`, even with separate build directories. Hosted CI jobs
already use separate checkouts.

```sh
python3 scripts/ci_verify.py debug --jobs 4
python3 scripts/ci_verify.py sanitizers --jobs 4
python3 scripts/ci_verify.py native --curl-dir /path/to/curl/lib/cmake/CURL \
  --require-websocket --jobs 4
```

The sanitizer profile uses the Linux CI ASan/UBSan environment, including
LeakSanitizer, which needs a supporting runtime. The native CI lane builds
checksum-pinned curl with WebSocket support and passes `--require-websocket`.
That flag turns a transport skip into failure. A local native run using system
curl may report the existing unsupported-WebSocket skip; that is not the required
Linux transport proof.

The kernel profile also gates the CTest row count: `tests/CMakeLists.txt`
drops every test TU whose include closure reaches `pineforge/source/` or
`compat/pine/`, so a lane whose native witnesses shared a TU with an adapter
twin would leave the kernel-only gate without any failure. `KERNEL_MIN_TESTS`
in `scripts/ci_verify.py` pins the expected row count; the `ctest-floor`
stage fails when CTest ran fewer rows or printed no count. Raise the constant
when a source-free row lands, and pass `--min-tests N` to override it for one
run (the flag gates any profile; only `kernel` has a default).

Pass `--ccache` when ccache is installed. It caches compiler work, not complete
build directories or verification receipts. Compiler, source, header and flag
checks remain in effect. The native curl cache is separately bound to its source
checksum, workflow configuration, compiler/package environment and install path.

## Version identity and historical ABI checks

Verification explicitly uses `PINEFORGE_VERSION_SOURCE=FILE`: package MMP/FULL
identity comes from `VERSION`, while Git revision/dirty observations remain
separate. Git tags and checkout depth cannot change the smoke-test expectation.
Ordinary CMake builds retain `AUTO`, the existing git-describe-first behavior.
No release tag or VERSION value is rewritten by verification.

The verifier fetches the pinned ABI commits `e60e571` (R2), `0e18690`
(selected settlement, before exact reversal), `c3ed455` (native host v13),
`f736676` (native host v14), `e7cdf052` (the frozen v15 source-layer base),
and `ab9714b` (the frozen v16 adapter-lowering base) without tags only when
each object is missing. It builds all six
prepared static libraries with tests disabled, or validates and reuses
their matching prepared receipts under `settlement-abi-base/`,
`settlement-abi-prior/`, `native-abi-v13/`, `native-abi-v14/`, and
`native-abi-v15-frozen/`, and `native-abi-v16-frozen/`. Compiler,
configuration and version-source mismatches refuse reuse without deleting the old evidence.
Each profile needs matching providers; a Mac Release archive cannot replace
a Linux sanitizer build. CTest itself performs no network fetch.
CTest authenticates all six prepared receipts against their actual archive and
header bytes. The executing settlement, script-host, and aggregate controls
use the authenticated `host-ab9714b` v16 archive plus the live v17 archive:
v16 callers link to v16, v17 callers link to v17, and both cross-epoch
directions must fail at link time with the expected epoch-qualified symbol.
No ABI caller executable is run. The older receipts remain authenticated
historical evidence; they are not presented as a live v13/v14/v15 link matrix.
The [ABI guide](../tests/fixtures/settlement_cpp_abi/README.md) describes the
actual old/new library pairs and their immutable inputs.

CTest writes `settlement-abi-receipt.json`, `script-abi-receipt.json`, and
`aggregate-abi-receipt.json` for the real v16/v17 controls, plus
`native-abi-receipt.json` for native controls. The native receipt includes the
active `v14_current_execution_shape_agnostic_compile`, frozen-v16
surface controls, and v17-current rejection controls against authenticated tar
closures. `CURRENT_TERMS_SURFACE_READY = True`: the complete current-execution,
FX, and missing-Cancelled controls are active, and the good caller compiles
before its intentional negative compile control. Ordinary compile failures
remain failures, separate from ABI link rejections.

## Failure evidence

Each build directory contains `ci-summary.json` and full command logs under
`ci-logs/`, plus CTest JUnit when the installed CTest supports it. A version
failure records both actual and expected values. GitHub Actions retains compact
diagnostics, CTest logs and ABI receipts and publishes the stage results in its
job summary. Native curl configure/build/install logs and dependency environment
identity are retained even if preparation fails before the verifier starts.
Compiler objects, binaries and dependency caches are not uploaded
as diagnostics.

Superseded pull-request runs are canceled. CI/native main/post-merge and manual proof runs
use distinct concurrency groups and remain uncanceled. Native verification is a
reusable workflow called once by CI, with a separate concurrency namespace; it
also supports manual dispatch. The required `build` check passes only when
preflight, all four standard builds, sanitizers and native verification succeed.
A failed, canceled or skipped dependency cannot produce a green `build` check.
The separate required `sanitizers` status remains available.

These checks do not run the parity campaign. Fixed-population Cloud measurement,
the actual gate and post-merge evidence remain separate acceptance steps.
